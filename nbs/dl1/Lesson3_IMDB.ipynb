       "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

       "xxbos xxmaj adult version of the classic xxmaj lewis xxmaj carroll tale is much better than you might expect . xxmaj here xxmaj alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image . xxmaj made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes , this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day . xxmaj despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs . xxmaj its an naughty little tale for adults . xxmaj if you 're wondering whether or not my recommendation is a good one or not consider that the film was pretty much only available in its non - hardcore version for the better part of the last three decades simply because the film stands up with out the sex , which is how i first saw the film years ago on cable xxup tv . xxmaj the relatively recent home video release on xxup dvd put back the sex ( in horribly grainy inserted clips ) which makes it clear the removal of the shots was the best choice all around . xxmaj if you 're an open minded adult with a taste for something spicy i can heartily recommend this little film as a nice diversion .,xxbos xxmaj realistic xxmaj master - xxmaj piece . thirty years later , the pictures can look a bit old , but actually , it only accurate the ' fist in the face ' effect of the movie . i never saw in my whole life a film like this one . xxmaj first time i saw it , i did n't know if it was a fiction ... xxmaj and xxmaj it did n't looked like ... xxmaj that movie is a masterpiece that every single person in the world have to see . xxmaj it 's the best ever society critical movie . xxmaj the ultimate movie that demonstrate that the system is down . xxmaj and the system has not change a lot , in thirty years . i think this movie would have to be watched as an education piece .,xxbos xxmaj robert xxmaj montgomery and xxmaj robert xxmaj young are outstanding as a duo of young submarine officers stationed in xxmaj italy during xxmaj world xxmaj war xxup i. xxmaj the dialog is highly entertaining , and xxmaj jimmy xxmaj durante is hilarious as the ship 's cook , \" xxmaj xxunk \" . xxmaj walter xxmaj huston 's character is inspiring as the captain of the submarine , a stellar example of an officer and a gentleman . xxmaj one of the most interesting aspects of this movie was the level of technology displayed in the battle scenes . i was surprised at how similar the technology of xxmaj world xxmaj war i was to the technology displayed 25 years later in xxmaj world xxmaj war xxup ii . xxmaj basic human nature was portrayed as very similar to modern times , and far from the xxunk i thought existed in the so - called \" innocent \" past . xxmaj all in all i felt that the cast , characters , action scenes , and view of history depicted in this movie were first - rate .,xxbos xxmaj putney xxmaj swope is the story of a token black man on the board of directors of a large advertising firm who is accidentally voted xxmaj chairman of the xxmaj board when the owner of the firm keels over while trying to stutter out an idea that he was apparently quite excited about . xxmaj putney , of course , takes his new role to heart and fires most everyone in the agency , hires a new crew ( all black except for a token white guy ) and proceeds to crank out the most offensive and non - xxup pc commercials one could ever ask for . xxmaj now it 's a rather motley crew he has and despite that they somehow manage to be successful while raking in the cash . i rather like the scene where potential advertisers are being relieved of bags of cash and then told to \" get out \" . xxmaj and their commercials will follow later , like them or not . xxmaj the story is good but of course the highlight here is the nasty commercials themselves , especially the one for \" xxmaj face xxmaj off \" acne cream . xxmaj this is rather dated , but still a fun movie , and full of hilarious moments . xxmaj robert xxmaj downey xxmaj sr . was working for an ad agency doing experimental ads at the time and i guess this was his middle finger to xxmaj madison xxmaj avenue agencies . xxmaj very good and pretty damned funny . 8 out of 10 .,xxbos xxmaj with xxup wwii over , movie studios quickly rushed to focus on vets returning home . \" xxmaj the xxmaj best xxmaj years of xxmaj our xxmaj lives \" was probably the best example . xxmaj it portrays various people returning home and how they have to readjust not only to their pre - war lives , but to the overall changing world . xxmaj probably the most interesting cast member is non - actor xxmaj harold xxmaj russell . xxmaj having lost his hands in the war , he plays a man with hooks where his hands used to be , and reminds people that he wants to be treated just like everyone else ; he went on to win xxmaj best xxmaj supporting xxmaj actor and a special xxmaj oscar for the role , making him the only person ever to win two xxmaj oscars for the same role . xxmaj there will probably always be debate over whether this deserved xxmaj best xxmaj picture more than \" xxmaj it 's a xxmaj wonderful xxmaj life \" , but i certainly think that they did a good job with it . xxmaj very well done .\n",

       "xxbos xxmaj adult version of the classic xxmaj lewis xxmaj carroll tale is much better than you might expect . xxmaj here xxmaj alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image . xxmaj made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes , this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day . xxmaj despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs . xxmaj its an naughty little tale for adults . xxmaj if you 're wondering whether or not my recommendation is a good one or not consider that the film was pretty much only available in its non - hardcore version for the better part of the last three decades simply because the film stands up with out the sex , which is how i first saw the film years ago on cable xxup tv . xxmaj the relatively recent home video release on xxup dvd put back the sex ( in horribly grainy inserted clips ) which makes it clear the removal of the shots was the best choice all around . xxmaj if you 're an open minded adult with a taste for something spicy i can heartily recommend this little film as a nice diversion .,xxbos xxmaj realistic xxmaj master - xxmaj piece . thirty years later , the pictures can look a bit old , but actually , it only accurate the ' fist in the face ' effect of the movie . i never saw in my whole life a film like this one . xxmaj first time i saw it , i did n't know if it was a fiction ... xxmaj and xxmaj it did n't looked like ... xxmaj that movie is a masterpiece that every single person in the world have to see . xxmaj it 's the best ever society critical movie . xxmaj the ultimate movie that demonstrate that the system is down . xxmaj and the system has not change a lot , in thirty years . i think this movie would have to be watched as an education piece .,xxbos xxmaj robert xxmaj montgomery and xxmaj robert xxmaj young are outstanding as a duo of young submarine officers stationed in xxmaj italy during xxmaj world xxmaj war xxup i. xxmaj the dialog is highly entertaining , and xxmaj jimmy xxmaj durante is hilarious as the ship 's cook , \" xxmaj xxunk \" . xxmaj walter xxmaj huston 's character is inspiring as the captain of the submarine , a stellar example of an officer and a gentleman . xxmaj one of the most interesting aspects of this movie was the level of technology displayed in the battle scenes . i was surprised at how similar the technology of xxmaj world xxmaj war i was to the technology displayed 25 years later in xxmaj world xxmaj war xxup ii . xxmaj basic human nature was portrayed as very similar to modern times , and far from the xxunk i thought existed in the so - called \" innocent \" past . xxmaj all in all i felt that the cast , characters , action scenes , and view of history depicted in this movie were first - rate .,xxbos xxmaj putney xxmaj swope is the story of a token black man on the board of directors of a large advertising firm who is accidentally voted xxmaj chairman of the xxmaj board when the owner of the firm keels over while trying to stutter out an idea that he was apparently quite excited about . xxmaj putney , of course , takes his new role to heart and fires most everyone in the agency , hires a new crew ( all black except for a token white guy ) and proceeds to crank out the most offensive and non - xxup pc commercials one could ever ask for . xxmaj now it 's a rather motley crew he has and despite that they somehow manage to be successful while raking in the cash . i rather like the scene where potential advertisers are being relieved of bags of cash and then told to \" get out \" . xxmaj and their commercials will follow later , like them or not . xxmaj the story is good but of course the highlight here is the nasty commercials themselves , especially the one for \" xxmaj face xxmaj off \" acne cream . xxmaj this is rather dated , but still a fun movie , and full of hilarious moments . xxmaj robert xxmaj downey xxmaj sr . was working for an ad agency doing experimental ads at the time and i guess this was his middle finger to xxmaj madison xxmaj avenue agencies . xxmaj very good and pretty damned funny . 8 out of 10 .,xxbos xxmaj with xxup wwii over , movie studios quickly rushed to focus on vets returning home . \" xxmaj the xxmaj best xxmaj years of xxmaj our xxmaj lives \" was probably the best example . xxmaj it portrays various people returning home and how they have to readjust not only to their pre - war lives , but to the overall changing world . xxmaj probably the most interesting cast member is non - actor xxmaj harold xxmaj russell . xxmaj having lost his hands in the war , he plays a man with hooks where his hands used to be , and reminds people that he wants to be treated just like everyone else ; he went on to win xxmaj best xxmaj supporting xxmaj actor and a special xxmaj oscar for the role , making him the only person ever to win two xxmaj oscars for the same role . xxmaj there will probably always be debate over whether this deserved xxmaj best xxmaj picture more than \" xxmaj it 's a xxmaj wonderful xxmaj life \" , but i certainly think that they did a good job with it . xxmaj very well done .\n",
